# Transmission Media Web Developer Exercise
This is a development exercise to complete my application for the web developer role.
## To run this application locally
Download the repository using \
`git clone https://github.com/mantisory/web-dev-exercise.git` \
Once the repository has cloned into the new directory, change to the new directory and run \
`npm install` \
This will install all the necessary libraries and dependencies.
This project also includes a gulpfile to assist with Sass builds automatically. \
To use it, type \
`npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass del` \
Once those packages have installed, type \
`gulp watch`\
Any time an scss file is modified and saved gulp will build new css files and distribute them to the /src/css folder
